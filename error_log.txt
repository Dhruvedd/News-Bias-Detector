Many of the artists who performed are from or based in Los Angeles.\nCalifornia native Katy Perry waved the state's flag as she performed hits such as California Gurls.\nOther stars taking to the stage included No Doubt, from Orange County, and Dr Dre, who performed his anthem California Love, a collaboration with the late 2Pac.\n\"This is a magical moment for me. I've got so much love, you guys... I appreciate all the first responders and all the firemen who put their lives on the line. It's all about love for me today,\" the rapper said.\nEilish duetted with rock band Green Day for a performance of Last Night on Earth. The band's frontman Billie Joe Armstrong told the crowd: \"We're still alive, this is California, and we're all in this together.\n\"From the bottom of our hearts, we love you Los Angeles, and we got your back no matter what.\"\nLater, Eilish was joined by her brother Finneas to perform her own hits including Wildflower and Birds of a Feather.\nElsewhere, Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks dedicated her Landslide performance to the firefighters who saved her home, and in doing so, likely saved her whole block.\n\"I was a full-on Pacific Palisadean woman with an old, beautiful, famous house that was almost taken from me as the fire came up the hill behind my house,\" Nicks recalled.\n\"And I was pretty sure, as they whisked me away and evacuated me - my least favorite word now - to another safe place, that when I turned around and looked my house would be up in flames.\"\nBut, the singer said her house \"stands strong, just like [me]. And in my opinion, she saved that whole street.\"\nActor Samuel L Jackson also made an appearance, praising the first responders as he introduced the crowd to a firefighter who lost his home in the blaze.\nThe actor then introduced the next musical guest, Rod Stewart, who performed Forever Young and Maggie May.\nAlanis Morisette wore an \"I Love LA\" T-shirt and performed her hit Thank U, which carried a sentiment of gratitude towards firefighters and other key workers.\nThe remaining members of 90s rock band Nirvana, Dave Grohl, Pat Smear and Krist Novoselic also reunited with a series of guest female vocalists such as St Vincent and Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon.\nOther stars appearing at the two shows include Olivia Rodrigo, Earth, Wind & Fire, Gracie Abrams, Sting and Tate McRae.\nJoni Mitchell, 81, made a rare public appearance, performing a rendition of Both Sides Now while sitting ona gold throne.\n\"Mitchell's observation that 'something's lost but something's gained in living every day' was met with a huge cheer. It felt like a dose of regal perspective from one of the all-time greats,\"said the Telegraph's James Hallin his review of the concert.\n\"The song was recorded in LA. And this is where this concert was most effective. The host of songs recorded in, or written about, LA reminded us about the place's musical pedigree and what could all too easily be lost.\"\nRed Hot Chilli Peppers performed their hit Under The Bridge, a paean to Los Angeles, with lyrics such as \"the city, she loves me\" taking on a new poignancy.\nThe night concluded with a performance from Lady Gaga, who delivered a powerful performance of her hit Shallow from the 2018 film A Star Is Born.\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris was one of the famous faces spotted in the crowd at the Intuit Dome.\nHer husband Doug Emhoff shared a picture taken inside the Intuit Dome on Instagram, with the caption: \"Kamala and I are grateful to be at the FireAid concert tonight in our hometown of Los Angeles.\n\"It is a wonderful night that shows the strength and resilience of our city as we begin to recover and rebuild from the devastating wildfires.\"\nAudiences watching the show were encouraged to donate online. Early in the concert, Crystal revealed that the band U2 had contributed $1m (\u00a3804,829).\nProceeds from the concert and donations during the show will go toward rebuilding communities and preventing future fires in the region.\nAt least 29 people died and more than 16,000 homes and businesses were destroyed in the fast-spreading, destructive fires that broke out in early January.\nViewers will be able to donate money to relief efforts during the show, either by text message or via the FireAidLA website.\nDonations will be overseen by the Annenberg Foundation, focusing on both short-term relief efforts and long-term fire prevention projects.\nAdditionally, Connie and Steve Ballmer - who own the LA Clippers basketball team, as well as the Intuit Dome and Forum - will match all donations made during the broadcast.\nThe Palisades and Eaton fires became thelargest fires ever seen in the LA areaearlier this month. Both erupted on 7 January as the region saw a strong wind event, making the small blazes in brushy, mountainous areas hard to contain.\nEmbers travelled miles, igniting whole communities and levelling neighbourhoods.\nNearly 7,000 structures were levelled in the Palisades fire in northwest LA.

As of the end of the year, nearly 10,000 fires had burned over 4.2 million acres, more than 4% of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California's modern history. California's August Complex fire has been described as the first \"gigafire\" as the area burned exceeded 1 million acres. The fire crossed seven counties and has been described as being larger than the state of Rhode Island. On August 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16\u201317. In early September 2020, a combination of a record-breaking heat wave, and Diablo and Santa Ana winds sparked more fires and explosively grew the active fires, with the August Complex more than doubling the Mendocino Complex's size to become California's largest recorded wildfire.Pictured: The LNU Lightning Complex which burned across wine country in August 2020."

As of the end of the year, nearly 10,000 fires had burned over 4.2 million acres, more than 4% of the state's roughly 100 million acres of land, making 2020 the largest wildfire season recorded in California's modern history. California's August Complex fire has been described as the first \"gigafire\" as the area burned exceeded 1 million acres. The fire crossed seven counties and has been described as being larger than the state of Rhode Island. On August 19, 2020, California Governor Gavin Newsom reported that the state was battling 367 known fires, many sparked by intense thunderstorms on August 16\u201317. In early September 2020, a combination of a record-breaking heat wave, and Diablo and Santa Ana winds sparked more fires and explosively grew the active fires, with the August Complex more than doubling the Mendocino Complex's size to become California's largest recorded wildfire.Pictured: The LNU Lightning Complex which burned across wine country in August 2020."

(AP Photo/Matt Rourke)\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) \u2014 A person in a car was the seventh fatal victim of the fiery crash of an air ambulance onto a busy Philadelphia street, authorities said Saturday, as investigators sifted through burned cars, damaged homes and charred debris for clues to determine why the aircraft plummeted shortly after takeoff.\nCarrying six people from Mexico, including a child who spent months in treatment at a hospital, the Learjet 55 went down just after departing from the Northeast Philadelphia Airport, creating what witnesses described as a massive fireball, shaking houses and leaving a chaotic street scene.\nAuthorities couldn\u2019t yet say why the jet crashed, and Adam Thiel, the city\u2019s managing director, said it could be days \u2014 or longer \u2014 until officials are able to fully count the number of dead and injured across a sprawling impact area in a densely populated residential area.\nThe plane took off, reached about 1,500 feet of altitude and then plummeted in a steep descent, crashing less than a minute after takeoff in what National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy called a \u201chigh-impact crash\u201d that left the plane \u201chighly fragmented.\u201d\nAP correspondent Julie Walker reports on another deadly plane crash, this one a small medical transport that crashed Friday night in Philadelphia.\nAs of Saturday morning, officials said, there were seven dead \u2014 six on the jet and the person in the car \u2014 and 19 injured. Most of the injured had been treated and released, hospitals said.\nThere are \u201ca lot of unknowns about who was where on the streets\u201d when the plane crashed, and it is possible that the casualty figures will grow, Thiel said.\nThe crash scene was at least four to six blocks, and authorities were working to assess the damage, including going house to house to inspect the dwellings, Thiel said.\nHomendy said her agency\u2019s staff was working to collect debris from the plane, which could take days or weeks, and haul it away to a secure location to begin evaluating it.\nAir traffic controllers didn\u2019t hear anything concerning before the crash, and her agency was still looking for thecockpit voice recorder, a helpful piece of evidence in the investigation, Homendy said.\nIt is likely damaged and possibly fragmented because of the impact, although her agency\u2019s researchers and engineers have significant expertise in repairing them, she said.\nThe plane hit the ground just after 6 p.m., during a busy Friday evening dinner hour less than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the airport.\n\u201cAll of sudden I heard like a \u2018boom,\u2019 and I thought it was a thunderstorm,\u201d said Selkuc Koc, a waiter at the Four Seasons Diner on Cottman Avenue. \u201cAnd I get up and look at the smoke and the fire, it was like a balloon. I thought it was a gas station that blew up.\u201d\nOne diner patron was hit and injured by a small but heavy metal object that flew through the window, Koc said.\nOf the six people on board the medical transport jet, one was a child who had just completed treatment at Shriners Children\u2019s Philadelphia hospital, one was her mother and four were crew members, officials said.\nA hospital spokesperson said the girl spent four months there receiving life-saving treatment for a condition not easily treated in Mexico. Shriners officials said they couldn\u2019t give details about the girl or her family because of patient privacy rules.\n\u201cHer journey was one of hope and of aspiration,\u201d spokesperson Mel Bower told The Philadelphia Inquirer. The relationships that the girl formed with staff \u201cwere true and were dear,\u201d and she\u2019ll be missed greatly by them, he said.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said all six victims on the plane were from her country. In a statement on the social media platform X, she mourned their deaths.\n\u201cConsular authorities are in constant contact with the families; I have asked the Foreign Affairs Secretary to support whatever is needed. My solidarity with their loved ones and friends,\u201d she said in Spanish.\nTijuana, Mexico, across the border from San Diego, was to have been the flight\u2019s final destination after a stop in Missouri.\nNeither Philadelphia officials nor plane owner Jet Rescue Air Ambulance disclosed the identities of the dead.\nBut XE M\u00e9dica Ambulancias, a Mexican emergency service, identified one of its doctors, Ra\u00fal Meza, as a victim. In a post on X, it said he was the service\u2019s chief of neonatology and assigned to a the ISEM Atizap\u00e1n hospital, which is in the State of Mexico near Mexico City.\nIn Veracruz, a city on the Gulf of Mexico, relatives of Josu\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez said he was the aircraft\u2019s co-pilot. They were preparing to hold a family ceremony and staying away from TV and social media to avoid seeing images of the crash.\nThey hadn\u2019t seen videos, but they were told that there was a horrible explosion, that the plane broke apart and that the crash scene covered several blocks, brother \u00c9dgar Ju\u00e1rez told The Associated Press by phone.\nJosu\u00e9 Ju\u00e1rez, 43, lived in central Mexico, loved salsa dancing and video games and had been a pilot for more than a decade, his brother said. He loved to fly and worked for the air ambulance service for more than a year, flying mostly from Mexico\u2019s Caribbean coast to the United States.\n\u201cHe was always aware that he had his risks, but the truth is that more accidents happen on the road,\u201d \u00c9dgar Ju\u00e1rez said.\nThe crash came just two days after thedeadliest U.S. air disasterin a generation. On Wednesday night, an American Airlines jet carrying 60 passengers and four crew memberscollided in midairin Washington, D.C., with an Army helicopter carrying three soldiers. There were no survivors.\nHomendy said the NTSB is a highly skilled agency, and that it is not unusual for it to investigate two major accidents at the same time.\nJet Rescue Air Ambulance, which operated the Mexico-registered Learjet 55, is based in that country and has operations both there and in Miami. A company spokesperson said a seasoned crew operated the plane, and all flight crews undergo rigorous training.\nThe Philadelphia crash was the second fatal incident in 15 months for Jet Rescue. In 2023 five crew members were killed when their plane overran a runway in the central Mexican state of Morelos and crashed into a hillside.\nThe Learjet took off from Northeast Philadelphia Airport, which primarily serves business jets and charter flights.\nAudio recorded by LiveATC captured an air traffic controller telling \u201cMedevac Medservice 056\u201d to turn right when departing. About 30 seconds later, the controller repeats the request before asking, \u201cYou on frequency?\u201d Minutes later the controller says, \u201cWe have a lost aircraft. We\u2019re not exactly sure what happened, so we\u2019re trying to figure it out. For now the field is going to be closed.\u201d\nMichael Schiavone was sitting at his home nearby when he heard a loud bang and the house shook.\n\u201cThere was a large explosion, so I thought we were under attack for a second,\u201d he said.\nA doorbell camera captured video of the plane plunging in a streak of white and exploding as it hit the ground.\n\u201cAll we heard was a loud roar and didn\u2019t know where it was coming from,\u201d said Jim Quinn, the doorbell\u2019s owner. \u201cWe just turned around and saw the big plume.\u201d\nLevy reported from Harrisburg.
